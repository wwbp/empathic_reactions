It's really fucking scary to think that just from a tiny little cut you could get a disease that has a high likelihood of killing you. There's also a similar bacteria called naegleria fowlerii that can get into your body from water going up your nostrils and it basically eats your brain. Nature is fucking metal.

You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying.

Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far.

I expect the worst from this world and only am surprised when something exceedingly good happens. That is a shame that such a gruesome scene cannot even make me feel anything. The world is a cesspool and we no longer have any integrity to show for it.

Why are so many people dying in the Med? there are not enough safety measures being put in place so that people can safely enjoy themselves. It is so easy to take someone's money but then you do not give them the safety that they paid for. It's sad and such a shame but honestly, I not at all surprised."
